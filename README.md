## Methodology
The initial check for runtime bottleneck was done by adding the following duration timers on all the methods in the main function. This was also used as a benchmark timing for the subsequent optimization exercises.
```
#include <chrono>
// Get the start time
auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

// Run the code you want to time
auto simulation = Simulation::FromFile(input);

// Get the end time
auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

// Calculate the duration
auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(end - start).count();
std::cout << "Function: Simulation::Method Name " << "Time taken: " << duration << " milliseconds" << std::endl;
```

The test file used was 5devadas13.in as it was already mentioned this takes a long time to produce an output. It was found that the 2 longest execution was from the methods Simulation::Run and boost::property_tree::write_json.
The 2 methods were targeted for optimization and the resulting improvement achieved was greater than 90% as can be seen in the table below.
